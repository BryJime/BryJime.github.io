  <h1>Personal Life</h1>
  <p class="background-paragraph" style="margin:0;">
      From a young age, I was fascinated by computers and technology. At 13, I inherited my brother’s old iPod Touch 4, and my curiosity about mobile software led me to discover jailbreaking. I quickly dove into customizing apps and interfaces, which sparked a lasting passion for UI and UX. That early obsession has stayed with me, and today I channel it into writing my own code and building software experiences that prioritize usability and design.

<h1>Background</h1>
<p class="background-paragraph" style="margin:0;"> 
In 2023, I became certified as a Radiologic Technologist. Working in healthcare showed me the impact technology can have on people’s lives, but I also felt a pull toward creativity and problem-solving through code. When I found LaunchCode, I finally had the starting point I’d been searching for. Their program introduced me to the fundamentals of software development, where I built skills in JavaScript, Java, and SQL, along with frameworks and tools like React, Spring Boot, and OOP. Today I’m using these skills to build programs that aim to improve daily life for others, working toward growing as a developer, with the goal of joining a team that values learning, collaboration, and making a positive impact.

<h1>HomeLife</h1>
<p class="homelife-paragraph" style="margin:0; "> 
When I am not coding or making xrays, I make music, am gaming or watching a movie classic! Going to metal concerts are one of my favorite things to do. I grew up in the metalcore scene, falling deep into music that emphazies breakdowns and heavy guitar riffs.
