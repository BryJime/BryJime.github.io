  <h1>Personal Life</h1>
  <p class="background-paragraph" style="margin:0;">
      From a young age, I was fascinated by computers and technology. At 13, I inherited my brotherâ€™s old iPod Touch 4, and my curiosity about mobile software led me to discover jailbreaking. I quickly dove into customizing apps and interfaces, which sparked a lasting passion for UI and UX. That early obsession has stayed with me, and today I channel it into writing my own code and building software experiences that prioritize usability and design.
